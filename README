This repository contains files that implement a simple mp3/wma player on
the Roku Digital Video Player(DVP).  There is a client component and a
server component.  The client component is a Brightscript application that
runs on the DVP and server is a Java application that generates an Xml file
listing the attributes of wma/mp3 files that can be played on the DVP.
