This is the client side of the music player. It operates by reading a
remote xml file that lists the attributes of the music files to be played
(see the example xml file). The remote machine requires a running web
server, i.e. Apache2.2.
 
Once the client application is running, go to the "xml file" poster under
the "settings" category and enter the url of the xml file on the keyboard
screen. Once the xml file has been processed, the "songs", "albums", and
"artists" categories will be populated.
