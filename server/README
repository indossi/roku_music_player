This is a server side of the music player.  It is a Java application that
generates a xml file listing the attributes and locations of mp3 and wma
files by recursively traversing a specified base directory.  Currently it
only supports processing a Windows-based music storage file structure,
but other file storage structures can be added.  It should be possible
for a single xml file to be generated from multiple base directories.

The "--wmadir <dir>" option specifies the base directory of wma music files.
This option can be specified more than once for multiple base directories.
 
The "--update" option updates a existing xml file instead of creating a new
one.

The "--url <url>" option specifies the url base directory that is to be
accessed from the DVP. 

Example(Linux):

$ java -jar musicXml.jar --wmadir /media/windows/Documents\ and\ Settings/user/My\ Documents/My\ Music/Zune --url http://192.168.0.122/pub


Notes:
1. The SDK url transfer calls appear unable to handle any remote file whose
name contains the pound, space, or ampersand characters, i.e.: '#', ' ', '&'.
One workaround is to create a symbolic link to offending files that has these
characters replaced or removed. The symbolic link is then used as an
attribute in the xml file. Whether the underlying problem is due to the
SDK or the Apache2.2 web server is unknown.
 
2. If an album's art is unavailalble, then set the album's art attribute in
the xml file to the empty string, i.e. "", which will result in the use of
the default generic album, artist and song art.
